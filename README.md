# rhetsec_ repository

This git repository serves as a copy of my portfolio as a culminating project for my Masters of Arts in Rhetoric & Writing at St. Cloud State University. This repository is a direct copy of http://www.linuxfingers.com from December 2019, deemed sufficient for graduation and completion of the Masters program.  The sole intent of this repository is posterity and preservation of my project for degree fulfillment. The original project (with tracked changes) is found at linuxfingers/portfolio. 

## abstract

Rhetsec_ examines the rhetorical situation, the rhetorical appeals, and how phishing emails simulate "real" emails in five categories of phishing emails. While the first focus of cybersecurity is security, you must also understand the language of computers to know how to secure them. Phishing is one way to compromise security using computers, and so the computer becomes a tool for malicious language (phishing emails and malware) to be transmitted. Therefore to be concerned with securing computers, then you must also be concerned with language. Language is rhetoric's domain, and the various rhetorical elements which create an identity of the phisher themselves, the false author, and their perception of their victims help us understand cyberattacks both offensive and defensively.
